# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.3.4

### Changed
* `HttpEngine::adapt_request` no longer forces engines to `.unwrap()`/`.expect()`
* `HttpEngine::adapt_response` drops the `BytesMut` round-trip for the default Streamable HTTP implementation.
* `parse_message` single-step decode + `Error::classify()`. Drops the `serde::Value` intermediate from the single-message hot path.
* Removed `'static` constraint for `HttpEngine::Request`, `HttpEngine::Response` and `HttpEngine::SseEvent` 

## 0.3.3

### Added
* **Pluggable HTTP server.** Introduced the `HttpEngine` trait so non-Volga HTTP stacks (axum, hyper, custom adapters) can plug into neva's Streamable HTTP transport. The engine declares its native request/response/SSE-event types and supplies four bridge methods plus a `run` loop; everything else (JSON-RPC framing, SSE replay & dedup, batch fast-path, pending-oneshot routing) stays in neva.
* New feature flags: `http-server` (engine-agnostic abstractions, no framework dependency) and `http-server-volga` (default Volga adapter). `server-full` enables the Volga variant for backwards compatibility.
* `dispatch_post` / `dispatch_delete` / `dispatch_get_sse` engine-generic route helpers — adapter handlers collapse to one-liners.
* Reference engine adapters under `examples/`: `axum` (Send-friendly types, the canonical pattern), `hyper` (raw protocol layer, no router), and `actix-web` (handles actix's `!Send` request/response types and its dedicated-runtime requirements).
* `neva::auth::Claims` is now neva's engine-neutral typed-claims contract. Any HTTP engine adapter can wrap its own decoded claims in `Arc<dyn Claims>` and insert them into request extensions to enable `with_roles` / `with_permissions` gating across tools, prompts, and resources.
* CI `doc_check` job gating on `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` with `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`.

### Fixed
* Broken intra-doc links and malformed code-block examples (`#[resource(...]` / `#[prompt(...]`) flagged by rustdoc.
* `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` is now warning-free and enforced in CI.

## 0.3.2

### Added
* Lazy cleanup for expired tasks

### Changed
* JSON RPC batches are now processing in parallel
* Improved pagination for `list/tools`, `list/prompts` and `list/resources` commands

### Fixed
* Removed unnecessary heap allocation for the middleware pipeline
* Request timeout and cleanup

## 0.3.1

### Added
* SSE backpressure configuration.
* Graceful session cleanup and sweeper for stale sessions

## 0.3.0

### Added
* Improved MCP Client DX for calling task-enabled tools.
* Added `wire_code()` method that returns a safe JSON-RPC 2.0 supported code. 

## 0.2.9

### Added
* SSE `Last-Event-ID` replay

### Fixed
* Fixed a bug when optional `params` field in `Request` was expected as required.

## 0.2.8

### Fixed
* Fixed JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol violation: server no longer sends a response to client notifications (§4 — notifications must never be replied to)
* Fixed `notifications/cancelled`: request cancellation now actually fires for both stdio and Streamable HTTP transports
* Fixed Streamable HTTP transport silently dropping notifications without processing them

## 0.2.7

### Added
* JSON-RPC Batch Support for client and server

### Fixed
* Fixed broken Streamable HTTP server implementation
